# NumPy Fundamentals Repository

## 📘 What is this project about?

This repository contains materials, code, and exercises focused on mastering NumPy—the foundational library for numerical computing in Python.
It is designed to be a core component of the broader data science curriculum, providing the essential skills needed for working efficiently with numerical data and laying the groundwork for libraries like Pandas and Scikit-learn.

## :star2: What is NumPy?

NumPy (Numerical Python) is the central package for scientific computing with Python. It provides a high-performance N-dimensional array object (ndarray) and tools for working with these arrays. This library is crucial because it allows for efficient operations on large sets of data, often orders of magnitude faster than standard Python lists.
