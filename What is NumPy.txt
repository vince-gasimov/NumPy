NumPy is an open source library available in Python
it helps in mathematical, scientific, engineering, and data science programming
It is a very useful library to perform mathematical and statistical operations in Python. 
It works perfectly for multi-dimensional arrays and matrix multiplication. 
It is easy to integrate with C/C++ and Fortran.

Why Use NumPy?

In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.
NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.
The array object in NumPy is called ndarray , it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.
Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important.

Why is NumPy Faster Than Lists?
NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists,

Scalar - Vector - Matrix - Tensor

Scalar
    - 0D array
    simple lement with single value

Vector
    - 1D array
    - an ordered list of elements

Matric
    - 2D array
    - a table or grid of ordered elements
    - it has 2 axes: rows and columns

Tensor
    - 3D array
    - srtucture in which elements are arranged in layers
    - it has 3 axes: width, hight, and depth

Syntex:
arr = np.array([1,2,3], [4,5,6])
